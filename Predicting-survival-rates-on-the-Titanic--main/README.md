# Predicting-survival-rates-on-the-Titanic

I'd like to share with you my thoughts and findings from my recent data science project in which I studied the Titanic database to predict the likelihood of passenger survival!

## About this project:

#### Purpose: In this project, I analyzed passenger data and built a predictive model of survival.
- Pre-processed the data: Filling missing values using Scikit-Learn library, transforming categorical variables.
- Model building: Used  machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier and Ada Boosting Classifier.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: To improve model performance, I performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- Model evaluation: Models were compared based on accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, with all used models.

Used Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

This project not only honed my data preprocessing and machine learning skills but also offered valuable insights into effective model evaluation techniques.
